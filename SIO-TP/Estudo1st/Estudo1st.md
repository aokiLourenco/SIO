# 1ยบ Slide -> Security

## Predictability of systems, processes, environments

### Across all aspects of the life cycle:

**Planning** -> Design of a solution complying with some requirements under a normative context.
Without flaws: All operations states are the ones predicted; There are no additional states escaping the expected logic (Even if forces transitions are used)

**Development** -> Implement a solution complying with the design, without other operation modes.
Without bugs compromising the correct execution: No crashes; Without invalid or unexpected results; With the correct execution times; With adequate resource consumption; Without information leaks

**Execution** -> Code excutes as it was written, with all predicted processes.
Environment is controlled, cannot be manipulated or observed
Without the existence of anomalous behavior, introduced by environmental aspects (storage speed, RAM amount, trusted communications)

**Processes**;

**People** -> Staff behavior cannot have a negative impact to the solution
Norms are in place to regulate what avtions are expected; Staff is trained to distinguish correct from incorrect behavior; Staff has the correct incentive to behave adequately; When staff is compromised, or deviate, actions have limited impact

Clients and Supply Chain;
Mechanisms;
Standards and Laws;
Intellectual Property;

-------------------------------

### SIO ojectives:

Confidentiality;
Integrity: Information remains unchanged;
Availability: Information is available to target entities;
Privacy: How personal information is handled;
Measures;

------------------------------

### Security objectives:

Defense against catastrophic events;
Degradation of computer hardware;
Defense against ordinary faults / failures;
Defense against non-authorized activities (adversaries)

------------------------------

#### Core Concepts:

1. Domains -> A set of entities sharing similar security attributes
Allow managing security in an aggregated manner;
Behavior and interactions are homogenousinside the domain;
Domains can be organized in a flat of hierarchical manner;
Interactions between domains are usually controlled;


2. Policies -> Set of guidelines related to security, that rule over a domain

Organization will contain multiple policies;
The multiple policies  must be coherent;
Define the power of each subject;
Define security procedures;
Define the minimun security requirements of a domain;
Define defense strategies and fight back tactics;
Define what are legal and illegal activities;

3. Mechanisms -> Mechanisms implement policies:

Policies define, at a higher level, what needs to be done or exist
Mechanisms are used to deply policies

4. Controls -> Controls are any aspect allowing to minimize risk (protect the CIA properties)

Cotrols include policies & mechanisms, but also Standars and Laws, Processes, Techniques
Controls are explicitly stated and can be auditable

------------------------------

**Policy**: Movement between domains is restricted
Mechanisms: Doors, guards, passwords, objects/documents

**Mechanism**: systems must be resilient
Mechanisms: equipments and links are doubled, arquitecture

------------------------------

### Types of Security Controls:

|                | Prevention                                                            | Detection                       | Correction                                                                 |   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|

| Administrative | -Contractal clauses -Separation of Duties -Information Classification | -Review Access Matrixes -Audits | -Implement a business continuity plan -Implement an incident response plan |   |

------------------------------

### Practical Security: Realistic Prevention

Consider Impact;
Consider the cost and recover time;
Characterize attackers;
Consider that the system will be compromised;

------------------------------

### Security in computing systems: Complex problems

Computers can do much damage in short time frames;
The number of weakness is always growing;
Networks allow novel attack mechanisms;
Attackers can build complex attck chains;
Users are mostrly unaware of the risks;
Users are mostly careless;

------------------------------

### Main vulnerability sources:

Hostile applications or bugs in applications;
Users;
Defective administration;
Communication over uncontrolled/unknown network links

------------------------------

### Perimeter Defense (minimal defense, frequently not sufficient)


Protection against external attackers;
Assumes that internal users are trusted and share the same policies;
Used in domestic scenarios or small offices;
Limitaions: Too simple, Doesn't protect against internal attackers

------------------------------

### Defense in Depth:

Protection against internal and external attackers;
Assumes well-defined domains across the organization;
Limitations: Needs coordination between the diferent controls, Cost, Requires training, changes to processes and frequent audits

------------------------------

### Zero Trust:

Defense model without specific perimeters;
Model recommended for new systems

### Zero Trust - Principles (NCSC)

1. Know your architecture (Users, devices, services and data)
2. Know your identities (Users, devices , services and data)
3. Assess user behaviour, servicesand device health
4. Use policies to authhorize requests
5. Authenticate and Authorize everywhere
6. Focus your monitoring on users, devices and services
7. Don't trust any network, including you rown
8. Choose services designed for Zero Trust

------------------------------
## Vulnerability:

A mistake in software that can be directly used by an attacker to gain access to a system or network

A mistake is a vulnerability <u>if it allows an attacker to use it to violate a reasonable security policy for that system</u>
<ul>
    <li> This excludes entirelly "open" security policies in which all users are trusted, or where there is no consideration of risk to the system
</ul>

A VE vulnerability is a state in a computing system (or set of systems) that either:
<ul>
    <li>Allows an attacker to execute commands as anotehr user</li>
    <li>Allows an attacker to access data that is contrary to the specified access restrictions for that data</li>
    <li>Allows an attacker to pose as another entity</li>
    <li>Allows an attacker to conduct a denial of service</li>
</ul>

------------------------------

## Exposure:

A configuration issues or a mistake in software allowing access to informationor capabilities used as a stepping-stone into a system or network

### A configuration issue or a mistake is an exposure if it does not directly allow compromise
<ul>
    <li>But could be an importat component of a successful attack, and is a violation of a reasonable security policy</li>
</ul>

### An exposure describes a state in a computong system (or set of systems) that id not a vulnerablity, but either:
<ul>
    <li>Allows an attacker to conduct information gathering activities</li>
    <li>Allows an attacker to hide activities</li>
    <li>Includes a capability that behaves as exepected, but can be easily compromised</li>
    <li>Is a primary  point of entry that an attacker may attempt to use to gain access to the system or data</li>
    <li>Is considered a problem by some reasonable security policicy</li>
</ul>

## Vulnerability detection

Specific tools can detect vulnerabilities
<ul>
    <li>Exploiting know vulnerabilities</li>
    <li>Testing know vulnerability patterns (buffer overflow, SQL injection, XSS, etc...)</li>
</ul>

Specific tools can replicate know attacks
<ul>
    <li>Use known exploits for know vulnerabilities(MS Samba v1 exploit used by WannaCry)</li>
    <li>Can be used to implement countermeasures</li>
</ul>

Vital to assert the robustness of production systems and applications
<ul>
    <li>Service often by third-party companies</li>
</ul>

Can be applied to
<ul>
    <li>Source code (static analysis): OWSAP LAPSE+, RIPS, Veracode, ...</li>
    <li>Running application (dynamic analysis): Valgrind, Rational, AppScan, GCC, ...</li>
    <li>Externally as a remote client: OpenVAS, Metasploit, ...</li>
</ul>

Should not be <u>blindly</u> applied to production systems!

<ul>
    <li>Potential data loss/corruption</li>
    <li>Potential DoS</li>
    <li>Potential illegal activity</li>
</ul>

------------------------------

## CWE Common Weakness Enumeration

Common language of discourse for discussing, finding and dealing with causes of software security vuneranilities
<ul>
    <li>Found in code, desig, or system archicture</li>
    <li>Each individual CWV represents a single vulnerability type</li>
    <li>Currently maintained by the MITRE Corporation: A detailed CWE list is currently available at the MITRE website</li>
    <li>The list provides a detailed definition for each individual CWE</li>
</ul>

Indivudual CWEs are held within a hierarchical structure
<ul>
    <li>CWEs at higher levels provide a broad overviwe of a vulnerability type: Can have children CWEs associated with them</li>
    <li>Cwes at deeper leveld provide a finer granularity: Usually have fewer or no children CWEs</li>
</ul>

**<p style="text-align: center;">CWE != CVE</p>**

## Static Analysis (with Sonarcloud)

![](image-4.png)

------------------------------

## Vulnerability Tracking by vendors

During the development cycle, vulnerabilities are handle as bugs
<ul>
    <li>May have a dedicated security team or not</li>
</ul>

When software id available, vulnerabilities are also tracked globally
<ul>
    <li>For every system and software publicly available</li>
</ul>

Public tracking helps...
<ul>
    <li>Focusing the discussion sround the same issue: Ex: a library is used in multiple applications, distributions</li>
    <li>Defenders to easily test their systems, enhancing the security</li>
    <li>Attackers to easily know what vulnerability can be used</li>
</ul>

------------------------------

## Vulnerability Tracking

Vulnerability are privately tracked
<ul>
    <li>Constitute an arsenal for future attacks against targets</li>
    <li>Exploints are weapons</li>
</ul>

Knowledge about vulnerabilities and exploits is publicly traded
<ul>
    <li>From 0 to 2-3Mโฌ (more?) through direct markets, or acquisition programs</li>
    <li>Up to 2.5Mโฌ for bug hunting programs or direct acquisition (Google, Zerodium): 2.5Mโฌ 1 click Android exploit, 2Mโฌ 1 click iPhone exploit, 1.5Mโฌ WhatsApp or iMessage exploit, ~2k for a XSS at HackerOne (although there are records of $1M payouts)</li>
</ul>

...and privately traded at unkown prices
<ul>
    <li>Private Companies, Organized Crime, APTs</li>
</ul>

------------------------------

## Zero Day (or Zero Hour) Attack/Threat

Attack using vulnerabilities which are:
<ul>
    <li>Unknown to others</li>
    <li>Undisclosed to the software vendor</li>
</ul>

Occurs at the day zero of the knowledge about those vulnerabilities
<ul>
    <li>For wich no secrity fix is available</li>
</ul>

A single "day zero" may exist for months/years
<ul>
    <li>Know to attackers, unknown to others</li>
    <li>Frequently part of attack arsenal</li>
    <li>Traded around in specific markets</li>
</ul>

------------------------------

## Survivability

<p style="text-align: center;">How can we survie a zero-day attack?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">How can we react to a massive zero-day attack?</p>

**Diversity is one answer (as a policy)...**
<ul>
    <li>but software production, distribution and update goes on the opposite direction!: And the same happens with hardware architectures</li>
    <br><li>Why is MS Windows such an interesting target?: And Apple macOS not so much?</li>
    <br><li>Are you using and Android cell phone?: What are the odds of beign in the battlefront? (you are); iOS landscape may be worst as it is more homogeneous</li>
</ul>
